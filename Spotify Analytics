# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Then I determined which 10 might be the best idea to invite to perform at a Festival based on danceability.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc
LIMIT 10

#I also determined which artists might be good contenders for longer sets by uncovering which artists had the largest number of tracks on this chart.
SELECT
artist_name,
count(artist_name) as track_count
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
Group BY artist_name
Order BY track_count desc
LIMIT 10

#In order to determine who might be a good contender for a headliner I found the ten artists had the most popularity on average.
SELECT
artist_name
,avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg(popularity) desc
LIMIT 10

#Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT 
s.artist_name, 
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)

SELECT 
artist_name,
average_popularity,
'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>= 90;
